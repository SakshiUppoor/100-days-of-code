# __Round 1 - Log__

### __Day 5: Mediocre day__
#### Sep 12, 2019 - Thursday

#### Today's Progress: 
* Debugged program to evaluate an algebraic equation
* Solved 10-15 problems on Applied Visual Design

#### Thoughts:
 Felt really uninspired to code. Should learn to manage time better as term tests are approaching.

#### Goals for tomorrow: 
* Start from the basic programs to build up confidence 
* Think of project ideas for DJ Unicode

### __Day 4: Practice, practice, practice__
#### Sep 10, 2019 - Tuesday

#### Today's Progress: 
* Implemented stacks & queues using arrays & linked lists
* Converted infix to post-fix using stack
* Implemented double ended queue

#### Thoughts:
Spend two hours of debugging only to realize that I typed '/0' instead '\0'. :|
Gotta be more mindful when I code. 

#### Goals for tomorrow: 
* Research about data structure projects & applications
* Build a website to apply UI & design knowledge I learned

### __Day 3: A bit of front-end & UI Design__
#### Sep 9, 2019 - Monday

#### Today's Progress: 
* Started learning Applied Visual Design from [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) 
* Solved 50% of the challenges in the Applied Visual Design section
* Researched about web design and buttons UI

#### Thoughts:  
Wish I could give more time to front-end dev. However, it's not the right time for it since term tests are demanding more time and once I'm done with them, I've got 2 mini-projects due. However, I'll try my best to take out 30 minutes everyday after tests for it and I'll spend my time on the train to research.

#### Plan of action for tommorow: 
* Probably learn and practice data structures as exams got pre-poned.

### __Day 2: Learning & Playing w/ JavaFX__
#### Sep 8, 2019 - Sunday

#### Today's Progress: 
* Implemented User Login, Signup & Authentication
* Learned how to connect to SQL Workbench
* Learned to connect views

#### Thoughts:  
Need to scour the web for more resources. Think it would be better to learn everything from scratch. Will take a course for it.

#### Plan of action for tommorow: 
* Look for courses on Java & JavaFX


### __Day 1: Solved some Competitive Programming on Number Theory__
#### Sep 7, 2019 - Saturday

#### Today's Progress: 
* Solved 5/8 questions
* Learned efficient way to find prime numbers
* Learned Fermat's Little Theorem to calculate power of large numbers fast

#### Thoughts:  
Solving CP questions after so long remind me why I loved doing them back in the break. Should really take time out of every week to attend the Codestars lectures or learn the topics thought on YouTube. The weekly practice questions on Hackerrank actually look promising. Looking forward to next week's questions.
