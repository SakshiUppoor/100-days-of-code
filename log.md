#### Thoughts:  
Need to scour the web for more resources. Think it would be better to learn everything from scratch. Will take a course for it.

#### Plan of action for tommorow: 
* Look for courses on Java & JavaFX


### __Day 1: Solved some Competitive Programming on Number Theory__
#### Sep 7, 2019 - Saturday

#### Today's Progress: 
* Solved 5/8 questions
* Learned efficient way to find prime numbers
* Learned Fermat's Little Theorem to calculate power of large numbers fast

#### Thoughts:  
Solving CP questions after so long remind me why I loved doing them back in the break. Should really take time out of every week to attend the Codestars lectures or learn the topics thought on YouTube. The weekly practice questions on Hackerrank actually look promising. Looking forward to next week's questions.
